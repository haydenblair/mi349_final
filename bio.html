		<p>Hi, I'm Hayden.</p>
		<p>I was born and raised in Bay City, MI and spent my youth playing sports and enjoying the natural wonders that Michigan has to offer. I volunteer as a puppy raiser for <a href="https://www.leaderdog.org">Leader Dogs for the Blind</a>. LDFTB is a non-profit in Rochester, MI that trains service dogs for the visually impaired. My part of this process involves picking up a puppy at about 8 weeks old, and raising/training them until they're about a year old.</p>
		<p>I started my journey at Michigan State University studying computer science. I stuck with this for 2 years, and decided at the end of my sophomore year that I wanted to study information science. I was more fascinated with good design and how people interact with technology than I was with building software.</p>
		<p>Currently, I work for MSU Athletics ITS, supporting infrastructure and sports technology throughout the department. I love being a part of figuring out how we can best support our athletes and coaches with technology, and I'm hoping to create a career for myself in college athletics.</p>
