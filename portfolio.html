			<p>iMakeTime is an iOS app that acts as a companion to a published self help book. I took this project on in 2019 and completed work for the client in about a year.</p>
			<p>The idea behind iMakeTime is that happiness in life is achievable by finding success and fufillment in 3 main categories of life. This app makes this program easier to follow by allowing users to customize a plan for them, and track their progress throughout the day.</p>

			<h3 class="card_header">isbcpsclosed.com</h3>
			<p>Created when I was in highschool, isbcpsclosed.com crawled local news websites for school closing data in the winter, and would tell you whether or not our district was closed due to inclement weather.</p>
			<p>To make the interface aestheticly pleasing, I learned about using CSS to animate things in a webpage, and added a basic snowfall effect to the background.</p>

			<h3 class="card_header">Eventose</h3>
			<p>Created at the University of Michigan's annual hackathon, Eventose is a product I created with a team that allows event attendees to check into conferences on their phone using bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacons.</p>
			<p>This project was created entirely within 36 hours, and was judged as an entry in the event competition. We were awarded the Most Professional prize by LinkedIn.</p>
			<p>I worked on the front end for the web based admin portal, and assisted with the development of our android app.</p>
